# First Day Setup: Your Development Environment

## 1. Python 3.4

Start by going to https://www.python.org/downloads/.  You'll probably see a prominent button for downloading Python for your operating system.  

If that doesn't work for you, or you'd like to see all of the available options, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/ and scroll down to the **Files** section.  Click on the release that best matches your operating system.

## 2. Code Editor

A code editor is a piece of software that is used to create and edit text files. It's like Microsoft Word, but for code files instead of word processing documents. 

Every Python installation comes with a coding environment called **IDLE**.  You can certainly use it if you would like.

In this class, we'll use Sublime Text.  Sublime has good support for Python coding, and is also used for other programming languages as well.  I will be using Sublime Text in class but you don't have to.  It costs $70 if you use it beyond the initial trial period.

### (Optional) Download and Install Sublime Text

If you would like to try Sublime Text, [click here to get it](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). This is called the "Sublime 3 Beta", but it's been out for a long time and is very stable. Download the appropriate installer for your computer and run it.

It's free to try out, but after 30 days you'll start to get nagged to pay for it (which I'd recommend you do – it's $70).

Also don't miss the "unofficial" but excellent [documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/index.html).

## 2. Git and Github

**Git** is a technology that professional developers use to store their code and share it with others. **Github** is a company that provides a popular hosted Git service.

### Create a Github account

Sign up for a free Github account at [the Github website](https://github.com/). You'll be using your Github account for lots of things in class – including turning in your homework and tracking your attendance in class – so keep your account information handy at all times.

### Download and Install the Github App

[For Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)

Once installed, run the Github app. You'll be asked to enter the Github username and password you've just created, along with your name and email address. Once you've done this, you should be at an empty "Dashboard view", and you're all set.

## 3. Create a place to store your code and download the project for the first class

We'll need a place to store all the code we'll be writing this quarter.

On Mac, create a folder called *code* in your home directory. (What's the home directory? In the *Finder*, it's accessible via the sidebar – it's the one with the "house" icon and is marked with the username you've used to log-in to your computer. You can also get there from the Finder menu, via Go -> Home).

On Windows, create a folder called *code* in the root of your C:\ drive.
