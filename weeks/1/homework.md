### 1. Setup Your Development Environment

1. Install Python 3.4.x on your computer.  
1. (Optional) Install a code editor like Sublime Text.

You should be able to write the following Python program and "run" it:

``` python
from platform import python_version
print("Hello UChicago!")
print("This is Python version " + python_version())
```

and you should see output like this:

```
Hello UChicago!
This is Python version 3.4.2
```

(If yours says 3.4.1, that's fine too)

### 2. Textbook Problem due Tuesday, January 13, 6:00pm

**Chapter 2: Exercise #8 on page 54**

You must turn in your solution by uploading it to Github.com. For this first week, you have two options.  The first is easier but will only work for this week.  The second requires more setup and requires learning a more about Git, but will work every week, not just for this week.

**Option 1: Easiest but temporary**
* Get a Github.com account
* Create a new repository named "week1", being sure to select "Create a README file"
* Create a new file called _solution.py_, and paste your program into it, and save it
* Email me your Github username or link to your homework repository

**Option 2: Harder but worthwhile**
* Get a Github.com account
* Install Git on your machine or download the [Github App for Mac](mac.github.com) or [for Windows](windows.github.com)
* Using the app (or git command line), create a new, local repository called "week1"
* Open your homework folder in Finder or Explorer, and add a file named _solution.py_ 
* Write your code in _solution.py1_
* _Commit_ and then _Sync_ your changes 

**How To Check That You've Turned In Your Homework**

* Go to your Github repository: https://www.github.com/{username}/week1
* Do you see a file listed there as _solution.py_?
* Can you click on that file to see the code?

If you can see your code on the Github website, then I'll be able to see it as well. You're done!
