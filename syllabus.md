## Concepts of Programming (MPCS 50101)

In this course, we provide an immersive introduction to programming for students who may not have prior experience. We will use the Python programming language to explore general-purpose computer programming and algorithmic reasoning, in an object-oriented context.

Students will learn:

1. how to construct algorithms, and express them as computer programs;
2. how to refine and improve programs by an iterative process;
3. the core principles of object-oriented programming;
4. fundamental data structures: arrays, sets, maps, and trees;
5. and the basics of computational efficiency and "big O" notation.


### Prerequisites
None.

### Required Textbook
"Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science", 2nd Edition (2010) by John Zelle, published by Franklin, Beedle & Associates.


### Calendar

Week 1: Basic computation, variables, and simple programs; GitHub and coding environment setup.
Week 2: Iteration, methods, and decision structures.
Week 3: Data structures, Part 1: lists, arrays, sets, and maps.
Week 4: Internet connectivity, defining protocols, and consuming web services.
Week 5: User-defined classes, static data vs. instance data, encapsulation.
Week 6: Class inheritance and polymorphism. [MIDTERM THIS WEEK]
Week 7: Recursion and computational efficiency.
Week 8: Data structures, Part 2: binary trees, heaps, and graphs.
Week 9: Algorithm design and Monte Carlo simulations.
Week 10: Statically-typed languages.
Week 11: FINAL EXAM.

### Office Hours and Lab Sessions

Office hours will be available via Google Hangouts as needed.

Lab sessions will be held weekly on Thursdays from 5pm-7pm.


### Grading

* Homework is worth a total of 40%.  There will be 6 weekly assignments (assinged during weeks 1-5, and week 9).  The lowest homework grade will be dropped.
* The midterm is worth 30% will be held during class on Week 6, and will cover material through week 5.
* The final exam is worth 30%.
