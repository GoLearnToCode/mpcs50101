## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Welcome! In MPCS 50101, we provide an immersive introduction to programming for students who may not have prior experience. We will use the Python programming language to explore general-purpose computer programming and algorithmic reasoning, in an object-oriented context.

Students will learn:

1. how to construct algorithms, and express them as computer programs;
2. how to refine and improve programs by an iterative process;
3. the core principles of object-oriented programming;
4. fundamental data structures: arrays, sets, maps, and trees;
5. and the basics of computational efficiency and "big O" notation.


## PREREQUISITES
None.

## COURSE TEXTBOOK
